A modern web application for analyzing contracts using Azure AI Document Intelligence (Content Understanding) and Azure OpenAI. Features a three-pane UI with document viewing, content extraction, and intelligent Q&A capabilities.

## Features

- 📄 **PDF Document Upload**: Upload contract documents for analysis
- 🔍 **Content Extraction**: Automatically extract headers and paragraphs using Azure AI Document Intelligence
- 📊 **Three-Pane Interface**:
  - **Left Pane**: PDF document viewer
  - **Middle Pane**: Extracted headers and paragraphs list with filtering
  - **Right Pane**: Content details and LLM-powered Q&A
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Q&A**: Ask questions about your contracts using Azure OpenAI
- 🎯 **Interactive Navigation**: Click on extracted content to view details and location

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Azure Services**:
  - Azure AI Document Intelligence (prebuilt-layout model)
  - Azure OpenAI for LLM integration

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Azure subscription with:
  - Azure AI Document Intelligence resource
  - Azure OpenAI resource with a deployed model

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or Navigate to Project

```bash
cd "Contract App"
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Dependencies are already installed. If needed, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Azure Credentials

Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying `.env.example`:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Azure credentials:

```env
# Azure Document Intelligence (Content Understanding) Configuration
AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_KEY=your_key_here

# Azure OpenAI Configuration
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-openai.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_key_here
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=your_deployment_name_here

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
```

#### How to Get Azure Credentials:

**Azure AI Document Intelligence:**
1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Create or navigate to your Document Intelligence resource
3. Go to "Keys and Endpoint" section
4. Copy the endpoint URL and one of the keys

**Azure OpenAI:**
1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Create or navigate to your Azure OpenAI resource
3. Go to "Keys and Endpoint" section
4. Copy the endpoint and key
5. Deploy a model (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-35-turbo) in Azure OpenAI Studio
6. Use the deployment name in your configuration

### 4. Run the Application

Use the VS Code task or run manually:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

### 5. Open in Browser

Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Usage

1. **Upload a Contract**: Click the "Upload Contract" button and select a PDF file
2. **View Extracted Content**: The middle pane will show all extracted headers and paragraphs
3. **Filter Content**: Use the filter buttons (All, Headings, Paragraphs) to narrow down the list
4. **Select Content**: Click on any item to view its details in the right pane
5. **Ask Questions**: Type questions in the Q&A section to get AI-powered answers about your contract

**Request**: multipart/form-data with `document` field (PDF file)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "filename": "contract.pdf",
  "filePath": "/uploads/1234567890-contract.pdf",
  "content": {
    "items": [...],
    "fullText": "...",
    "pageCount": 5
  }
}
```

### POST `/api/query`
Ask a question about the uploaded contract.

**Request**:
```json
{
  "question": "What is the termination clause?"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "answer": "The termination clause states..."
}
```

### GET `/uploads/:filename`
Retrieve uploaded PDF file.

## Development

To run in development mode with auto-restart:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Azure AI Services**:
  - `@azure/ai-form-recognizer` - Document Intelligence SDK
  - `openai` - Azure OpenAI integration
- **Other Libraries**:
  - `multer` - File upload handling
  - `cors` - Cross-origin resource sharing
  - `dotenv` - Environment variable management

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` file to version control
- Keep your Azure keys secure
- Uploaded files are stored temporarily in the `uploads/` directory
- Consider implementing file cleanup and size limits for production use

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] PDF viewer with highlight functionality for selected sections
- [ ] Support for more document formats (Word, images)
- [ ] Document comparison features
- [ ] Export analyzed content
- [ ] User authentication and document management
- [ ] Advanced search within documents
- [ ] Annotation and commenting features

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Server won't start
- Check that port 3000 is not in use
- Verify `.env` file exists and has correct values

**Issue**: Document analysis fails
- Verify Azure Document Intelligence credentials
- Check that the PDF file is valid and not corrupted
- Ensure your Azure resource has sufficient quota

**Issue**: Q&A not working
- Verify Azure OpenAI credentials
- Ensure your deployment name is correct
- Check that you've uploaded a document first
